- Cleaned up Makefile by removing obsolete Docker targets
- Updated docker-push-multiarch target to better support local testing with .env file

### Added
- Created .env.example file documenting GitHub PAT token configuration
- Added docker-inspect-multiarch target for verifying multi-architecture images

## [0.0.6] - 2025-06-13

### Fixed
- Fixed GitHub Container Registry push errors by adding proper image labels
- Added package initialization step to ensure registry package exists
- Resolved 403 errors by linking Docker images to the repository with org.opencontainers.image.source label

### Changed
- Simplified Docker push approach back to using docker/build-push-action
- Disabled SBOM generation in addition to provenance

### Added
- Instructions for using Personal Access Tokens for local Docker registry testing

## [0.0.5] - 2025-06-13

### Fixed
- Reworked Docker image building to push platform-specific images before creating multi-arch manifest
- Added registry access verification step to debug authentication issues
- Fixed step ordering to ensure version extraction happens before registry operations

### Changed

## [0.0.4] - 2025-06-13

### Fixed

## [0.0.3] - 2025-06-13

### Changed
- Optimized Docker release process to use pre-built binaries instead of compiling during image creation
- Simplified Docker image publishing to create multi-arch images directly without intermediate architecture-specific tags
- Docker images are now built from binary artifacts, significantly reducing CI/CD pipeline time

- Fixed clippy warnings about manual string stripping

### Added
- Comprehensive tests for DN case insensitivity
- Support for composite LDAP filters (AND, OR, NOT)
- Support for substring filters in LDAP searches
- Tests verifying correct LDAP error codes are returned

### Changed
- Enhanced LDAP filter parser to support nested and complex filter expressions
