## [0.0.10] - 2025-06-13

### Added
- Enhanced LDAP filter support with two new filter types:
  - Approximate match filters `(attr~=value)` for fuzzy matching
  - Extensible match filters `(attr:=value)`, `(attr:dn:=value)`, `(attr:matchingRule:=value)`
- Support for LDAP filter escape sequences (e.g., `\28` for `(`, `\2a` for `*`)
- Common matching rules support: caseIgnoreMatch (2.5.13.2), caseExactMatch (2.5.13.5)
- DN component matching with `:dn:` modifier in extensible filters
- Protocol decoder support for approximate match (tag 0xA8) and extensible match (tag 0xA9) filters
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new filter types

### Changed
- Improved filter parser to handle escaped characters in filter values
- Enhanced protocol decoder to properly parse complex extensible match filters

### Fixed
- Filter values now properly handle escape sequences according to RFC 4515

## [0.0.9] - 2025-06-13

### Fixed
- Added support for LDAP Abandon Request operation (tag 0x50) to prevent connection drops with django-auth-ldap

### Added
- Implemented LDAP Abandon Request handling (RFC 4511 Section 4.11)
- Implemented LDAP Extended Request/Response operations (tags 0x77/0x78) for future extensibility
- Added proper response for StartTLS Extended operation (returns unavailable)
- Added comprehensive tests for Abandon and Extended operation functionality

## [0.0.8] - 2025-06-13

### Fixed
- Added support for LDAP Compare operation (tag 0x6e) which was causing Django LDAP authentication to fail

### Added
- Implemented LDAP Compare Request/Response handling in SimpleLdapCodec
- Added comprehensive tests for Compare operation functionality

## [0.0.7] - 2025-06-13

### Fixed

- Added registry access verification step to debug authentication issues
- Fixed step ordering to ensure version extraction happens before registry operations

### Changed
- Split multi-platform Docker build into separate platform builds followed by manifest creation
- Added explicit buildx commands for better control over the build process

## [0.0.4] - 2025-06-13

### Fixed
- Fixed Docker image push authentication errors by disabling provenance attestations
- Resolved 403 Forbidden errors when pushing multi-arch images to GitHub Container Registry

### Changed
- Updated GitHub workflow to set `provenance: false` for Docker builds with pre-built binaries

## [0.0.3] - 2025-06-13

### Changed
- Optimized Docker release process to use pre-built binaries instead of compiling during image creation
- Simplified Docker image publishing to create multi-arch images directly without intermediate architecture-specific tags
- Docker images are now built from binary artifacts, significantly reducing CI/CD pipeline time

### Added
